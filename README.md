# Real Time Chat Application
This repository contains the source code for a real time chat application with user specific features, built using MEAN Stack and Socket.io.

## Instructions to Run
**Make sure to run the Backend code before the Frontend.**
* #### Frontend:
  ```
  cd Frontend\ChatApp
  ng serve -o
  ```
  This will automatically serve and open ```http://localhost:4200``` in your browser.
* #### Backend:
  ```
  cd Backend
  node app.js
  ```
  This will create the server listening on ```http://localhost:3000```.
